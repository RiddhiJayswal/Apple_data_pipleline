# Apple Inc. Data Analysis and Pipeline Project

This project demonstrates data analysis and pipeline creation in Databricks using a dummy dataset modeled on Apple Inc. Key insights were extracted and ETL pipelines were developed to streamline data processing and analysis.

## Project Overview

This repository contains:

- **Data Generation**: A dummy dataset was created to simulate Apple Inc.'s data for exploration and analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Insights were derived by analyzing the dataset to uncover product buying patterns of customer.
- **Pipeline Creation**: ETL pipelines were built in Databricks to automate data ingestion, transformation and processing.

## Key Features

- **Dummy Dataset**: Small Custom-made dataset simulating real-world data for Apple Inc.
- **Data Insights**: Analyzed data to extract useful insights, highlighting key trends and metrics.
- **Automated Pipelines**: Created ETL pipelines in Databricks to handle data processing efficiently.
